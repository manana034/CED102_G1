        <p>Buckwheat belongs to a group of foods commonly called pseudocereals.<br>
            Pseudocereals are seeds that are consumed as cereal grains but don’t grow on grasses. Other common pseudocereals include quinoa and amaranth.<br>            
            Despite its name, buckwheat is not related to wheat and is thus gluten-free.<br>            
            It’s used in buckwheat tea or processed into groats, flour, and noodles. The groats, used in much the same way as rice, are the main ingredient in many traditional European and Asian dishes.<br>            
            Buckwheat has become popular as a health food due to its high mineral and antioxidant content. Its benefits may include improved blood sugar control.</p>

            <p>2.改善消化<br>蕎麥富含纖維。膳食纖維是一種基於植物的碳水化合物，人體在消化過程中不會分解。纖維有助於腸道有效消化食物，也幫助食物通過消化道。它還可能具有其他益處，例如促進體重減輕和預防心血管疾病。<br>
                一杯蕎麥還含有1.58毫克推薦的14至16毫克成人菸鹼酸。菸鹼酸或維生素B-3對於將碳水化合物，脂肪和蛋白質轉化為能量供身體細胞使用至關重要。作為纖維和菸鹼酸的良好來源，蕎麥是消化健康的良好選擇。<br>
                蕎麥有可能引起蕎麥過敏症患者的反應。在食用蕎麥時，他們可能會出現症狀，例如口腔腫脹或蕁麻疹。然而，有關蕎麥過敏的報導並不常見。
